# Description
My Information Security midterm project.

Problem statment: "Fake news" has recently become a topic interest. Can "fake news" statements be identified through textual analysis?

I found a short paper attempting the answer this questions using sophisticated machine learning methods and attempted to replicate their results using simpler methods.

I achieved a similar measure of accuracy to their nerual network using a flavor of Naive Bayesian classification.
